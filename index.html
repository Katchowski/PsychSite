    <h4>What is the brain?</h4>
    <p>
        The brain is the most complex organ in the human body. It produces our every thought, action, memory, feeling and experience of the world. This jelly-like mass of tissue, weighing in at around 1.4 kilograms (~3 pounds), contains a staggering one hundred billion nerve cells, or neurons. The brain is often described as being “like a muscle”. It can grow fitter, stronger and more effective the more we challenge it.

    <h4>Why does the brain exist?</h4>
    <p>
        The brain is the command center for the human body. It receives input from the sensory organs and sends output to the muscles. To do this, it has to be able to receive and process information about the world outside. It also has to be able to store and recall memories, control movement, and generate thoughts and feelings. The brain achieves all this by sending electrical signals along nerve cells. These signals are passed from one cell to another by chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.
