<h3>Neurons and the Nervous System</h3>

<div class="textHolder">
    <h4>Neurons:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Neuron: A nerve cell; the basic building block of the nervous system.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Dendrite: The bushy, branching extensions of a neuron that receive messages and conduct impulses toward the cell body. (soma)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Axon: The extension of a neuron through which nerve impulses are sent.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Axon terminal: The endpoint of a neuron where neurotransmitters are stored.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Neural Impulses</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Action potential: A neural impulse; a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Refractory period: A brief instant after a neuron has fired during which it cannot generate another action potential because it is recharging.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Resting potential: The state of a neuron when it is charged and waiting for the next action potential.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            All-or-none response: A neuron's reaction of either firing (with a full-strength response) or not firing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Communication between neurons</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Synapse: The tiny, tiny, fluid filled gap between the axon terminal of one neuron and the dendrite of another.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Neurotransmitters: Chemical messengers that cross the synaptic gaps between neurons. When released by the sending neuron, neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptor sites on the receiving neuron, influencing whether that neuron will generate a neural impulse.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Excitatory effect: A neurotransmitter effect that makes it more likely that a receiving neuron will generate an action potential or "fire".
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Inhibitory effect: A neurotransmitter effect that makes it less likely that a receiving neuron will generate an action potential or "fire".
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h4>How neurons function</h4>
    <p>
        Neurons function by receiving signals from other neurons through their dendrites. These signals are then passed along the axon to the axon terminal, where they are released as neurotransmitters into the synapse. The neurotransmitters then bind to receptor sites on the dendrites of other neurons and the process repeats. This process happens billions of times every second in the brain, allowing for the rapid communication between neurons that is necessary for all brain functions.

    <h4>Structures of the Nervous system</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Central Nervous System (CNS): The brain and spinal cord.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): The sensory and motor neurons that connect the central nervous system to the rest of the body.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Somatic Nervous System: The division of the peripheral nervous system that controls the body's skeletal muscles.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Autonomic Nervous System: The part of the peripheral nervous system that controls the glands and the muscles of the internal organs (such as the heart).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Sympathetic Nervous System: The division of the autonomic nervous system that arouses the body, mobilizing its energy in stressful situations.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Parasympathetic Nervous System: The division of the autonomic nervous system that calms the body, conserving its energy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h4>The Endocrine System</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Endocrine System: One of the body's two communication systems; a set of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Hormones: Chemical messengers that are manufactured by the endocrine glands, travel through the bloodstream.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pituitary Gland: The endocrine system's master gland. Under the influence of the hypothalamus, the pituitary controls other endocrine glands.
        </li>
    </ul>
