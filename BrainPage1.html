<h3>Brain Structure</h3>

<div class="textHolder">
    <h4>Lower level brain structures:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Brain stem: The brain stem is the oldest part of the brain, beginning where the spinal cord swells and enters the skull. It is responsible for automatic survival functions.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Medulla: The base of the brain stem, controls heartbeat and breathing.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Reticular Formation: A nerve network in the brainstorm that plays an important role in wakefulness and arousal.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Thalamus: The brain's sensory switchboard, located on top of the brain stem. It directs messages to the sensory receiving areas in the cortex and transmits replies to the cerebellum and medulla.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Cerebellum: The "little brain" attached to the rear of the brain stem. It helps coordinate voluntary movements and balance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>

<div class="textHolder">
    <h4>The limbic system:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Hypothalamus: A neural structure lying below the thalamus. It directs several maintenance activities (eating, drinking, body temperature), helps govern the endocrine system via the pituitary gland, and is linked to emotion.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Hippocampus: A neural center located in the limbic system that helps process new memories for long term storage.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Amygdala: The two lima-bean sized neural clusters in the limbic system that control emotional responses, such as fear and anger.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="textHolder">
    <h4>The cerebral cortex</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The cerebral cortex: The intricate fabric of interconnected neural cells covering the cerebral hemispheres. The body's ultimate control and information processing center.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Corpus callosum: The large band of neural fibers connecting the two brain hemispheres and carrying messages between them. Damaging this can cause the two hemispheres to not communicate properly.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Frontal lobes: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying just behind the forehead that is involved in judgement and planning. Damage to this area can cause a person to lose their ability to plan for the future.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Parietal lobes: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying at the top of the head and toward the rear; includes somatosensory cortex and general areas for processing information. Damage to this area can cause a person to lose their ability to process some sensory information.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Occipital lobes: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying at the back of the head; includes the primary visual processing areas of the brain. Damage to this area can cause a person to lose their ability to process visual information.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Temporal lobes: The portion of the cerebral cortex lying roughly above the ears; includes the auditory areas of the brain. Damage to this area can cause a person to lose their ability to process auditory information.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Longitudinal fissure: The long crevice that separates the brain into the left and right hemispheres.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Motor cortex: Strip of cortex at the rear of the frontal lobes that controls voluntary movements. Damage to this area can cause a person to lose their ability to control their movements.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Somatosensory cortex: strip of brain tissue at the front of the parietal lobes that registers and processes body touch and movement sensations. Damage to this area can cause a person to lose their ability to process some sensory information.
        </li>
    </ul>
