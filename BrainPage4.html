    <h4>Study #1</h4>
    <p>
        “Teens are also bombarded by information in this electronic age, and multitasking is as routine as chatting with friends online. But Jensen highlights a recent study showing how sensory overload can hinder undergraduates’ ability” (The Teen Brain | Harvard Magazine, 2008).
        <br><br>
        This study from Harvard shows how the teenage brain is affected by the constant bombardment of information and multitasking that is common in the digital age. The study shows that sensory overload can hinder the ability of undergraduates to focus and learn. This study is important because it shows how the teenage brain is affected by the digital age and how it can hinder learning.

        <!--kids brains diff from adult brains-->
        Teen brains are different from adult brains. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps with decision-making, impulse control, and organization, is not fully developed until the mid-20s. This means that teens are more likely to act impulsively and take risks than adults. The teenage brain is also more sensitive to rewards and less sensitive to punishment than the adult brain. This means that teens are more likely to take risks in order to get rewards.

<h3>Case Studies</h3>
<div class="textHolder">
    <h4>What is a Case Study?</h4>
    <p>
        A case study is a research method that involves an up-close, in-depth, and detailed examination of a subject of study (the case), as well as its related contextual conditions. Case studies can be produced by following a formal research method. These case studies are likely to appear in formal research venues, as journals and professional conferences, rather than popular works. The resulting body of 'case study research' has long had a prominent place in many disciplines and professions, ranging from psychology, anthropology, sociology, and political science to education, clinical science, social work, and administrative science.

    <h4>Why are case studies important?</h4>
    <p>
        Case studies are important because they help make something being discussed more realistic for both teachers and learners. Case studies help students to see that what they have learned is not purely theoretical but instead can serve to create practical solutions to real dilemmas. Case studies are also beneficial for teachers as they can be used as a teaching tool to demonstrate the application of a theory or concept to real situations.

    <h4>Case Study #1</h4>
    <p>
        Phineas Gage was a railroad worker who survived a severe brain injury that dramatically changed his personality and behavior. His case played a significant role in the development of the understanding of the brain and its functions. Gage's case is one of the first to suggest that damage to specific parts of the brain can affect personality and behavior. This case study is important because it shows how damage to the brain can affect personality and behavior.

    <h4>Case Study #2</h4>
    <p>
        Split-brain patients are individuals who have had the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain, severed. This procedure is used to treat severe epilepsy. Split-brain patients have been studied to understand the functions of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. This case study is important because it shows how the brain is divided into two hemispheres and how each hemisphere has different functions.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Split-brain research has shown that the left hemisphere is responsible for language and speech, while the right hemisphere is responsible for spatial abilities and facial recognition. Split-brain research has also shown that the two hemispheres of the brain can function independently of each other. This research is conducted by presenting information to only one hemisphere of the brain (generally through the eyes) and observing the response of each hemisphere.
