<h3>Scanning Techniques</h3>

<div class="textHolder">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT or CT scan): A series of x-ray photographs taken from different angles and combined by computer into a composite representation of a slice through the body.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      (functional) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ((f)MRI): Techniques using magnetic fields and radio waves to produce computer-generated that distinguish among substances; allows us to see structures within the brain (MRI). and track blood flow to see what parts of the brain are active during given tasks (fMRI).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Electroencephalogram (EEG): An amplified recording of the waves of electrical activity that sweep across the brain's surface. These waves are measured by electrodes placed on the scalp.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET scan): A visual display of brain activity that detects where a radioactive form of glucose goes while the brain performs a given task.
    </li>
  </ul>
